I graduated from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in June 2018 with a specialization in Coastal and Marine Management. My master's group project investigated the economic feasibility of seaweed aquaculture in southern California. This summer I will be assisting in the annual calculation of the Ocean Health Index global scores. My interests are in sustainable seafood, aquaculture/fisheries, ocean data science, and scuba diving!
