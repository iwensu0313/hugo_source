>Stay with me in Anza Borrego

>Lay beneath the starry sky

>Night after night, engaged in silence

>The darkness, and forever companions

>Here we find a relentless sun

>But there they are,

>The soft magenta petals

>They urge us on

>Remind us of beauty

>Alongside the thorns 

>That we must all bear.
