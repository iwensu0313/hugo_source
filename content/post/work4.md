Once upon a time between 2015 and 2016, I organized an informal San Diego meetup group among my immediate contacts for "young ocean conservation & science professionals" (wow what a mouthful) and I made these wonderful AMATEUR infographics. Really I just wanted to drink beer and talk about the ocean.

I have to shield my eyes as I'm uploading these.

### Infographic 1

*Summarizing the main points of Marine Cage Culture and the Environment, Price and Morris 2013.*

### Infographic 2

*Outline of criteria NOAA uses for* [*MPA site selection.*](https://nmssanctuaries.blob.core.windows.net/sanctuaries-prod/media/archive/management/pdfs/overview_mod1_curr2.pdf).

What am I? Pretending to be a marine-scientist-know-it-all over here?? Sometimes I don't understand the things I do.

I can't handle this. 

The first one I was quite proud of as I think it does give one a quick rundown of where aquaculture research stood. But then I just started getting embarrased. How much time did I have on my hands? I mean, I was working at CDFW and Hubbs Research Institute, and volunteering at WildCoast and as a sci-diver with SDSU folks. Good thing I love to drive myself into the ground with things to do.
