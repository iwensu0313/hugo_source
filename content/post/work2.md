While I was at the Bren School, I co-proposed and worked on a project looking into the feasibility of seaweed aquaculture in southern California.

My interest in aquaculture began when I was a field assistant at the Hubbs-Seaworld Research Institute in San Diego for the white seabass restoration project. After working in San Diego for about 2 years, I moved to Santa Barbara to complete a master's program in coastal and marine management. I proposed a project with my colleague Shelby Oliver to study the bioeconomic feasibility of seaweed aquaculture in southern California with the guidance of a local mussel farmer and other experts in the field. Find out more about our research, results, and data at our [project website](https://sbmussels.weebly.com/).

The executive summary of our report can be found [here](https://iwensu0313.github.io/seaweed/index.html) with download links to the full report, project brief, and publics presentation at the bottom.

I also decided to spend a bunch of free time expanding on a Shiny app to present our data. This will be out soon!
